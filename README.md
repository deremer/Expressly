# Expressly
### A blueprint for an Express-based Node.js web app.

----

## Why
Setting up a new Express app each time is tedious. It's imperative to have a good flexible structure that you understand very well. But setting it up each time is a hassle. Cloning this repo is a shortcut.

## What
This is my system. This is how I organize Express apps. It allows for centralized "config" as well as dynamic addition of route/controller/model files. Following this formulat gets me up and running quickly.
